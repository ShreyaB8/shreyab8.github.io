Passionate about accelerating LLM inference with cutting-edge techniques like speculative decoding and kernel fusion. I specialize in optimizing high-performance machine learning libraries, focusing on graph optimization and operator fusion for deep learning workloads. My expertise extends to compiler optimization and hand-tuned SIMD kernels, ensuring peak performance for mobile and edge devices. With a strong interest in HW/SW co-design, I thrive at the intersection of software and hardware, enabling efficient AI systems.

Favorite subreddit: r/localllama, where I stay updated on the latest in LLMs and local AI innovation.
